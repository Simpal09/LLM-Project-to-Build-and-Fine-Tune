1. Loading a Pre-trained Large Language Model and Tokenizer
Model: GPT-2 (gpt2) from the Hugging Face transformers library.
Tokenizer: Used for processing text data, ensuring compatibility with the model.
Padding is handled by setting the pad_token to the eos_token.
2. Dataset Preparation
Input Dataset: A synthetic dataset with e-commerce-related sentences for fine-tuning.
Preprocessing:
Tokenization with truncation and padding.
Convert the dataset into a tokenized format for model training.
3. Model Fine-Tuning
Objective: Train the model on the e-commerce dataset using the Trainer API.
Training Configuration:
Learning rate, number of epochs, batch sizes, and logging settings.
Save and evaluation strategy set to steps for checkpointing and validation.
4. Evaluation
Metric: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation).
Purpose: Assess the performance of the model on text generation tasks.
Implementation:
Decode predictions and references.
Compute ROUGE scores for generated text.
5. Prompt Engineering and PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
Prompt Tuning:
A configuration for efficient fine-tuning using fewer parameters.
Task type set to CAUSAL_LM for causal language modeling.
PEFT Integration: Modify the model to support prompt tuning for specific tasks.
6. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)
Goal: Optimize model outputs based on human preferences.
Placeholder: The project provides a placeholder for RLHF, requiring further human-labeled data and advanced optimization techniques.
7. Knowledge Grounding via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Purpose: Enhance responses by grounding them in relevant knowledge.
Implementation:
Placeholder for a retrieval mechanism to fetch related documents based on user input.
Combine retrieved knowledge with user input for model generation.
8. Chatbot Application
Use Case: E-commerce chatbot.
Features:
Accepts user queries, retrieves relevant knowledge, and generates responses.
Utilizes the fine-tuned LLM for high-quality answers.
9. Example Usage
Interaction:
Query: "What are the return policies for electronics?"
Response: Generated text leveraging the fine-tuned model and RAG.
